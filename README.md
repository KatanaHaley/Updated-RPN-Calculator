This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

Welcome to the RPN Calculator CLI

## Architecture
The Calculator function performs Reverse Polish Notation by accepting postfix notation inputs and provides the calculated sum as an output.

Following good practice, the function returns an error early if there is no input in the calculator. The program does not run in this instance.

The calculator has four valid operators; +, -, /, and *. More operators can be added. It's also possible to integrate a WebSocket interface.  

## How the calculator works
The calculator first splits the input string and an empty array is created. The program either returns an error early or continues execution. 

The function then loops over each index in the string, if the index is a number it's pushed into the stack. When the for loop is complete, the last two inputs in the stack are popped out. These last two inputs are operators.

If 'q' is entered, the program quits immediately. The function goes through a series of checks to find matching operators. If a match is found, the operation is performed. Lastly, if only one number is provided, the program will throw an error.

Given more time on this project I would create a hosted UI.

## Instructions
1. To use the calculator, you'll need to download Node JS v15.12.0. 
2. To run tests install Mocha and Chai `npm i mocha` and `npm i chai`.
3. Download the Reverse Polish Notation Calculator zip file or clone with `git clone https://github.com/KatanaHaley/Updated-RPN-Calculator.git`. 
4. Open the command line and open the Updated-RPN-Calculator in your IDE. 
6. Enter `cd src` on the command line to navigate to the src directory. 
6. To use the calculator, enter your calculation into console.log(), ex:`console.log(Calculator("5 8 +");`. 
7. To see the output run `node Calculator.mjs` in your terminal. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


### `mocha test` or `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
